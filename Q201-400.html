A web application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances accepts the appointment requests. The text messages are published to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue through the web application. Another application that runs on EC2 instances then sends meeting invitations and meeting confirmation email messages to the customers. After successful scheduling, this application stores the meeting information in an Amazon DynamoDB database. As the company expands, customers report that their meeting invitations are taking longer to arrive. What should a solutions architect recommend to resolve this issue?</span></p><p><span>A. Add a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in front of the DynamoDB database.</span></p><p><span>B.

This meets the requirement for managing fine-grained permissions for the data.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other solutions have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Migrating Data to RDS</span></strong><span>: This approach increases the complexity and operational overhead by consolidating all data into RDS, which is not optimized for large-scale analytics.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Periodic Copy and Athena</span></strong><span>: While this solution allows for querying data using Athena, it does not provide fine-grained access controls as effectively as Lake Formation.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>Amazon Redshift</span></strong><span>: Although Redshift is suitable for large-scale data warehousing and analytics, it does not offer the same level of fine-grained access control as Lake Formation and involves more operational overhead in managing the data transfer and integration.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id='question-205-host-a-marketing-website-on-aws-using-amazon-cloudfront'><span>Question #205 Host a marketing website on AWS using Amazon CloudFront</span></h3><p><strong><span>Topic 1</span></strong></p><p><span>A company hosts a marketing website in an on-premises data center. The website consists of static documents and runs on a single server. An administrator updates the website content infrequently and uses an SFTP client to upload new documents. The company decides to host its website on AWS and to use Amazon CloudFront. The company&#39;s solutions architect creates a CloudFront distribution. The solutions architect must design the most cost-effective and resilient architecture for website hosting to serve as the CloudFront origin. Which solution will meet these requirements?</span></p><p><span>A. Create a virtual server by using Amazon Lightsail. Configure the web server in the Lightsail instance.

The company currently copies AMIs to the same AWS Region where the AMIs were created. The company needs to design an application that captures AWS API calls and sends alerts whenever the Amazon EC2 CreateImage API operation is called within the company&#39;s account. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?</span></p><p><span>A. Create an AWS Lambda function to query AWS CloudTrail logs and to send an alert when a CreateImage API call is detected.</span></p><p><span>B. Configure AWS CloudTrail with an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification that occurs when updated logs are sent to Amazon S3.

Create an AWS Lambda function to send an alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a CreateImage API call is detected.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for the CreateImage API call. Configure the target as an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to send an alert when a CreateImage API call is detected.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)</span></strong><span>: EventBridge allows you to create rules that can trigger actions based on specific AWS API calls. By setting up a rule for the CreateImage API call, you can automatically detect when this API is called.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Amazon SNS</span></strong><span>: Configuring the target as an SNS topic allows you to send alerts easily. SNS provides a simple way to send notifications to various endpoints such as email, SMS, or other AWS services.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Least Operational Overhead</span></strong><span>: This solution is straightforward and requires minimal setup and maintenance. EventBridge directly integrates with AWS services and provides a seamless way to capture and respond to specific events.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other solutions have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Lambda Function with CloudTrail</span></strong><span>: This approach involves querying CloudTrail logs, which adds complexity and increases operational overhead compared to using EventBridge rules.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>CloudTrail with Athena</span></strong><span>: While this method can achieve the desired outcome, it involves setting up and maintaining Athena queries, which is more complex and less efficient than using EventBridge.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>SQS with Lambda</span></strong><span>: This solution introduces additional components (SQS and Lambda) that increase operational overhead and complexity compared to the direct integration provided by EventBridge and SNS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id='question-207-improve-the-reliability-of-an-asynchronous-api-using-amazon-dynamodb'><span>Question #207 Improve the reliability of an asynchronous API using Amazon DynamoDB</span></h3><p><strong><span>Topic 1</span></strong></p><p><span>A company owns an asynchronous API that is used to ingest user requests and, based on the request type, dispatch requests to the appropriate microservice for processing. The company is using Amazon API Gateway to deploy the API front end, and an AWS Lambda function that invokes Amazon DynamoDB to store user requests before dispatching them to the processing microservices. The company provisioned as much DynamoDB throughput as its budget allows, but the company is still experiencing availability issues and is losing user requests. What should a solutions architect do to address this issue without impacting existing users?</span></p><p><span>A. Add throttling on the API Gateway with server-side throttling limits.</span></p><p><span>B. Use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.</span></p><p><span>C. Create a secondary index in DynamoDB for the table with the user requests.</span></p><p><span>D. Use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>D. Use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon SQS for Buffering</span></strong><span>: By using Amazon SQS to buffer writes to DynamoDB, you can decouple the ingestion of user requests from the processing of those requests. This helps to handle spikes in traffic and ensures that user requests are not lost even if DynamoDB is temporarily unable to handle the load.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Lambda for Processing</span></strong><span>: AWS Lambda can be used to poll the SQS queue and write the requests to DynamoDB at a controlled rate. This approach smooths out the write operations to DynamoDB, preventing it from being overwhelmed and reducing the likelihood of availability issues.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Throttling on API Gateway</span></strong><span>: Adding throttling limits on the API Gateway can prevent the API from being overwhelmed, but it does not address the root cause of the issue, which is DynamoDB&#39;s inability to handle the write throughput.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)</span></strong><span>: DAX is used to accelerate read performance, not write performance. It would not help in buffering writes to DynamoDB.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>Secondary Index in DynamoDB</span></strong><span>: Creating a secondary index can improve query performance but does not directly address the issue of write throughput and availability.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id='question-208-secure-data-transfer-from-ec2-to-s3'><span>Question #208 Secure data transfer from EC2 to S3</span></h3><p><strong><span>Topic 1</span></strong></p><p><span>A company needs to move data from an Amazon EC2 instance to an Amazon S3 bucket. The company must ensure that no API calls and no data are routed through public internet routes. Only the EC2 instance can have access to upload data to the S3 bucket. Which solution will meet these requirements?</span></p><p><strong><span>Options:</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 in the subnet where the EC2 instance is located.

The API stores this data in an Amazon RDS DB instance for later analysis. The amount of data that the monitoring devices send to the API fluctuates. During periods of heavy traffic, the API often returns timeout errors. After an inspection of the logs, the company determines that the database is not capable of processing the volume of write traffic that comes from the API. A solutions architect must minimize the number of connections to the database and must ensure that data is not lost during periods of heavy traffic. Which solution will meet these requirements?</span></p><p><span>A. Increase the size of the DB instance to an instance type that has more available memory.</span></p><p><span>B.

Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SQS invokes to write data from the queue to the database.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon SQS for Buffering</span></strong><span>: Using Amazon SQS to buffer incoming data helps decouple the data ingestion from the database writes. This ensures that even during periods of heavy traffic, data is not lost because it is queued in SQS.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>AWS Lambda for Processing</span></strong><span>: AWS Lambda can be triggered by SQS to process the queued messages and write them to the database. This approach minimizes the number of concurrent connections to the database, as Lambda can scale the processing based on the queue size.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Decoupling and Scalability</span></strong><span>: This solution decouples the API from the database, allowing the system to handle fluctuating traffic more effectively. It also leverages the scalability of SQS and Lambda to manage the varying load.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Increasing DB Instance Size</span></strong><span>: While increasing the size of the DB instance might temporarily alleviate the problem, it does not address the fluctuating nature of the traffic and can be more costly.

The company is manually managing replication and scaling as demand increases or decreases. The company needs a new solution that simplifies the process of adding or removing compute capacity to or from its database tier as needed. The solution also must offer improved performance, scaling, and durability with minimal effort from operations. Which solution meets these requirements?</span></p><p><span>A. Migrate the databases to Amazon Aurora Serverless for Aurora MySQL.</span></p><p><span>B. Migrate the databases to Amazon Aurora Serverless for Aurora PostgreSQL.</span></p><p><span>C. Combine the databases into one larger MySQL database. Run the larger database on larger EC2 instances.</span></p><p><span>D. Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group for the database tier.

Migrate the databases to Amazon Aurora Serverless for Aurora MySQL.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon Aurora Serverless for Aurora MySQL</span></strong><span>: Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora. It automatically adjusts the database capacity based on the application&#39;s needs, which simplifies the process of adding or removing compute capacity. This option provides improved performance, scaling, and durability with minimal operational effort.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Improved Performance and Durability</span></strong><span>: Aurora MySQL is designed to offer enhanced performance and durability compared to standard MySQL. It provides features such as automatic scaling, high availability, fault tolerance, and automated backups.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Aurora Serverless for Aurora PostgreSQL</span></strong><span>: While Aurora PostgreSQL is a powerful database, the company&#39;s current databases are running on MySQL. Migrating to Aurora PostgreSQL would require additional effort to convert the databases and application code to be compatible with PostgreSQL.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>Larger MySQL Database on Larger EC2 Instances</span></strong><span>: Combining databases into a larger MySQL database and running it on larger EC2 instances does not address the need for automatic scaling and would still require manual management of replication and scaling.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>EC2 Auto Scaling Group for Database Tier</span></strong><span>: Creating an EC2 Auto Scaling group for the database tier is not a recommended approach for database scaling and management. Databases require careful handling of state and consistency, and auto-scaling EC2 instances for databases can introduce complexities in managing replication and data consistency. Aurora Serverless provides a more seamless and managed solution for these requirements.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id='question-230-implementing-a-scalable-and-fault-tolerant-nat-solution'><span>Question #230 Implementing a scalable and fault-tolerant NAT solution</span></h3><p><strong><span>Topic 1</span></strong></p><p><span>A company is concerned that two NAT instances in use will no longer be able to support the traffic needed for the company&#39;s application.

The software accepts job requests from users to process data that has been uploaded to Amazon S3. Users report that some submitted data is not being processed. Amazon CloudWatch reveals that the EC2 instances have a consistent CPU utilization at or near 100%. The company wants to improve system performance and scale the system based on user load.

Route incoming requests to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling group based on queue size. Update the software to read from the queue.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon SQS for Decoupling Requests</span></strong><span>: By routing incoming requests to Amazon SQS, you can decouple the job requests from the processing instances. This allows for better handling of varying user load and ensures that all requests are queued up for processing.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Auto Scaling Group Based on Queue Size</span></strong><span>: Configuring an EC2 Auto Scaling group based on the size of the SQS queue allows the system to dynamically scale the number of EC2 instances based on the load. When the queue size increases, more instances are launched to handle the increased load, and when the queue size decreases, instances are terminated to save costs.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Improved Performance and Scalability</span></strong><span>: This approach ensures that the system can handle spikes in user requests without overwhelming the EC2 instances. It also provides a scalable solution that adjusts to the workload, improving overall system performance and user experience.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Application Load Balancer</span></strong><span>: Simply creating a copy of the instance and placing all instances behind an Application Load Balancer does not address the issue of scaling based on user load. It also does not handle the queuing of job requests.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>S3 VPC Endpoint</span></strong><span>: Creating an S3 VPC endpoint may improve network performance and reduce costs but does not address the core issue of high CPU utilization and scaling based on user load.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>More Powerful Instance Type</span></strong><span>: Upgrading to a more powerful instance type may temporarily alleviate the high CPU utilization but does not provide a scalable solution. As user load increases, the upgraded instances may also become overwhelmed.</span></p><p><span>By using Amazon SQS and an EC2 Auto Scaling group, the solution architect can create a robust, scalable, and efficient system that meets the company&#39;s requirements for improved performance and scalability based on user load.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id='question-249-implementing-a-shared-storage-solution-with-smb-access'><span>Question #249 Implementing a shared storage solution with SMB access</span></h3><p><strong><span>Topic 1</span></strong></p><p><span>A company is implementing a shared storage solution for a media application that is hosted in the AWS Cloud.

Use Amazon S3 as the target. Enable an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the logs to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon S3 as the Target</span></strong><span>: Storing VPC Flow Logs in Amazon S3 is a cost-effective solution that allows for easy access and long-term retention. S3 is highly durable and scalable, making it suitable for storing large volumes of log data.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>S3 Lifecycle Policy</span></strong><span>: By configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy, you can automatically transition the logs to a different storage class based on their age. In this case, transitioning the logs to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days ensures cost savings for infrequently accessed data while still providing quick access when needed.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Cost Efficiency and Accessibility</span></strong><span>: Using S3 Standard-IA for logs that are accessed intermittently after 90 days reduces storage costs compared to keeping them in S3 Standard. This approach balances cost efficiency with the need for occasional access to the logs.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Amazon CloudWatch</span></strong><span>: Using CloudWatch for storing VPC Flow Logs with an expiration of 90 days is not cost-effective for long-term storage. CloudWatch is more suitable for short-term monitoring and alerting rather than long-term log retention.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Amazon Kinesis</span></strong><span>: Kinesis is designed for real-time data streaming and processing, not long-term log storage. Configuring Kinesis to retain logs for 90 days is not practical and would be more expensive compared to using S3 with a lifecycle policy.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>AWS CloudTrail</span></strong><span>: CloudTrail is used for logging API calls and user activity within AWS, not for capturing network traffic in VPC Flow Logs. While it can save logs to an S3 bucket, it is not the appropriate service for this use case.</span></p><p><span>By using Amazon S3 with a lifecycle policy to transition logs to S3 Standard-IA after 90 days, the solutions architect can meet the requirements for frequent access initially and intermittent access later, while optimizing storage costs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id='question-251-enabling-outbound-internet-access-for-an-ec2-instance-in-a-private-subnet'><span>Question #251 Enabling outbound internet access for an EC2 instance in a private subnet</span></h3><p><strong><span>Topic 1</span></strong></p><p><span>An Amazon EC2 instance is located in a private subnet in a new VPC.

Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>NAT Gateway</span></strong><span>: A NAT gateway allows instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from the internet. This is the recommended solution for providing internet access to instances in a private subnet.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Public Subnet</span></strong><span>: The NAT gateway must be placed in a public subnet, which has a route to the internet gateway. This ensures that the NAT gateway can route traffic to and from the internet.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Private Subnet Route Table</span></strong><span>: The route table for the private subnet should have a route that directs all internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT gateway.

After a routine compliance check, the company sets a standard that requires a recovery point objective (RPO) of less than 1 second for all its production databases. Which solution meets these requirements?</span></p><p><span>A. Enable a Multi-AZ deployment for the DB instance.</span></p><p><span>B. Enable auto scaling for the DB instance in one Availability Zone.</span></p><p><span>C. Configure the DB instance in one Availability Zone, and create multiple read replicas in a separate Availability Zone.</span></p><p><span>D.

Enable a Multi-AZ deployment for the DB instance.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Multi-AZ Deployment</span></strong><span>: Enabling a Multi-AZ deployment for an Amazon RDS instance provides high availability and automatic failover support. In a Multi-AZ configuration, Amazon RDS automatically replicates the data synchronously to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone. This ensures that the data is highly available and can be recovered with minimal data loss, meeting the requirement of an RPO of less than 1 second.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Synchronous Replication</span></strong><span>: Multi-AZ deployments use synchronous replication, which means that any changes to the primary instance are immediately replicated to the standby instance. This ensures that the standby instance is always up to date with the primary instance, providing the necessary data protection to meet the RPO requirement.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Auto Scaling in One Availability Zone</span></strong><span>: Enabling auto scaling for the DB instance in one Availability Zone does not provide the necessary high availability and data protection to meet an RPO of less than 1 second. Auto scaling is more relevant to compute resources rather than database availability.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>Read Replicas in a Separate Availability Zone</span></strong><span>: While read replicas can provide increased read scalability and some level of redundancy, they use asynchronous replication. This means that there can be a lag between the primary instance and the read replicas, which does not guarantee an RPO of less than 1 second.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>AWS DMS Change Data Capture (CDC) Tasks</span></strong><span>: Using AWS DMS with change data capture (CDC) tasks can help in replicating changes, but it does not provide the same level of immediate data consistency and automatic failover as a Multi-AZ deployment.

The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The number of transactions can vary, but the baseline CPU utilization that is noted on each run is at least 60%. The company needs to provision the capacity 30 minutes before the jobs run. Currently, engineers complete this task by manually modifying the Auto Scaling group parameters. The company does not have the resources to analyze the required capacity trends for the Auto Scaling group counts. The company needs an automated way to modify the Auto Scaling group&#39;s desired capacity. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?</span></p><p><strong><span>Options:</span></strong></p><p><span>A.

The company stores the data in an Amazon DynamoDB table and uses applications to analyze the data. The data workload is constant and predictable. The company wants to stay at or below its forecasted budget for DynamoDB.</span></p><p><strong><span>Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Options:</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Use provisioned mode and DynamoDB Standard-Infrequent Access (DynamoDB Standard-IA). Reserve capacity for the forecasted workload.</span></p><p><span>B. Use provisioned mode.

Specify the read capacity units (RCUs) and write capacity units (WCUs) with reserved capacity.</span></p><p><strong><span>Correct answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>B. Use provisioned mode. Specify the read capacity units (RCUs) and write capacity units (WCUs).</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Provisioned Mode (Option B)</span></strong><span>: Using provisioned mode allows the company to specify the exact number of read capacity units (RCUs) and write capacity units (WCUs) required for the workload. Since the workload is constant and predictable, this approach enables the company to allocate just enough capacity to handle the workload efficiently, keeping costs predictable and controlled. Provisioned mode is generally more cost-effective for workloads with predictable usage patterns compared to on-demand mode, which can be more expensive for steady-state applications.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Provisioned Mode with DynamoDB Standard-IA</span></strong><span>: While using provisioned mode with DynamoDB Standard-Infrequent Access (DynamoDB Standard-IA) can reduce costs for infrequently accessed data, it is not suitable for constant and predictable workloads where data is accessed regularly. Standard-IA is designed for data that is accessed less frequently, which does not align with the company&#39;s requirements.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>On-Demand Mode</span></strong><span>: On-demand mode is suitable for workloads with unpredictable traffic patterns as it automatically adjusts capacity based on usage. However, it is typically more expensive than provisioned mode for constant and predictable workloads. Setting RCUs and WCUs high enough to accommodate changes in the workload would lead to unnecessary costs.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>On-Demand Mode with Reserved Capacity</span></strong><span>: On-demand mode does not support reserved capacity. Reserved capacity is a feature of provisioned mode, allowing companies to commit to a specific amount of capacity over a period (e.g., one or three years) for a discount. Therefore, this option is not valid.</span></p><p><span>By using provisioned mode and specifying the necessary RCUs and WCUs, the company can effectively manage DynamoDB costs while ensuring that the capacity meets the predictable workload requirements.

The documents are stored in Amazon S3. The documents are usually written only once, but they are updated frequently. The reporting process takes a few hours with the use of relational queries. The reporting process must not prevent any document modifications or the addition of new documents. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to speed up the reporting process. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of change to the application code?</span></p><p><span>A. Set up a new Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) cluster that includes a read replica. Scale the read replica to generate the reports.</span></p><p><span>B. Set up a new Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster that includes an Aurora Replica. Issue queries to the Aurora Replica to generate the reports.</span></p><p><span>C. Set up a new Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Multi-AZ DB instance.

The application uses an Amazon API Gateway Regional API endpoint to give users the ability to retrieve current stock prices. The company&#39;s security team has noticed an increase in the number of API requests. The security team is concerned that HTTP flood attacks might take the application offline.</span></p><p><span>A solutions architect must design a solution to protect the application from this type of attack.</span></p><p><strong><span>Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the API Gateway Regional API endpoint with a maximum TTL of 24 hours.</span></p><p><span>B. Create a Regional AWS WAF web ACL with a rate-based rule. Associate the web ACL with the API Gateway stage.</span></p><p><span>C. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the Count metric and alert the security team when the predefined rate is reached.</span></p><p><span>D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with Lambda@Edge in front of the API Gateway Regional API endpoint. Create an AWS Lambda function to block requests from IP addresses that exceed the predefined rate.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>B. Create a Regional AWS WAF web ACL with a rate-based rule. Associate the web ACL with the API Gateway stage.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>AWS WAF with Rate-Based Rule</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Rate-Based Rule</span></strong><span>: AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) allows you to create rate-based rules, which can limit the number of requests from a single IP address over a specified period. This is effective in mitigating HTTP flood attacks.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Integration with API Gateway</span></strong><span>: By associating the WAF web ACL with the API Gateway stage, you can protect the API endpoint from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Minimal Operational Overhead</span></strong><span>: AWS WAF is a managed service that requires minimal operational effort to set up and maintain. It provides a straightforward way to implement rate limiting without the need for custom code or additional infrastructure.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Other Options</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>CloudFront with TTL (Option A)</span></strong><span>: While CloudFront can help with caching and reducing the load on the API Gateway, it does not provide specific protection against HTTP flood attacks. Additionally, setting a maximum TTL of 24 hours may not be suitable for real-time stock prices.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>CloudWatch Metrics (Option C)</span></strong><span>: Monitoring with CloudWatch metrics can alert the security team to potential issues, but it does not provide automatic protection or mitigation against HTTP flood attacks.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>CloudFront with Lambda@Edge (Option D)</span></strong><span>: Using Lambda@Edge to block requests based on rate limiting involves more operational overhead compared to using AWS WAF. It requires writing and maintaining custom Lambda functions and managing the deployment of these functions at the edge locations.</span></p></li></ul></li></ol><p><span>By creating a Regional AWS WAF web ACL with a rate-based rule and associating it with the API Gateway stage, the company can effectively protect the web application from HTTP flood attacks with minimal operational overhead. This solution leverages AWS WAF&#39;s built-in capabilities to provide automated and scalable protection against excessive request rates.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id='question-400-sending-alerts-for-new-weather-events-in-a-dynamodb-table'><span>Question #400 Sending alerts for new weather events in a DynamoDB table</span></h3><p><strong><span>Topic 1</span></strong></p><p><span>A meteorological startup company has a custom web application to sell weather data to its users online. The company uses Amazon DynamoDB to store its data and wants to build a new service that sends an alert to the managers of four internal teams every time a new weather event is recorded. The company does not want this new service to affect the performance of the current application. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?</span></p><p><span>A. Use DynamoDB transactions to write new event data to the table. Configure the transactions to notify internal teams.</span></p><p><span>B. Have the current application publish a message to four Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Have each team subscribe to one topic.</span></p><p><span>C. Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table. Use triggers to write to a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe.</span></p><p><span>D. Add a custom attribute to each record to flag new items. Write a cron job that scans the table every minute for items that are new and notifies an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to which the teams can subscribe.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>C. Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table. Use triggers to write to a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>DynamoDB Streams</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Action C</span></strong><span>: Enabling DynamoDB Streams on the table allows capturing changes to the table, such as inserts, updates, and deletes. By using DynamoDB Streams, the company can set up triggers (AWS Lambda functions) that process these changes without affecting the performance of the current application.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>SNS Integration</span></strong><span>: The Lambda function can be configured to publish messages to a single Amazon SNS topic whenever a new weather event is recorded. The internal teams can then subscribe to this SNS topic to receive alerts.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Operational Overhead</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Minimal Overhead</span></strong><span>: Using DynamoDB Streams with Lambda and SNS requires minimal operational overhead. The solution leverages managed services (DynamoDB Streams, AWS Lambda, and SNS) that automatically handle scaling, monitoring, and maintenance.</span></p></li></ul></li></ol><p><span>Other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>DynamoDB Transactions</span></strong><span>: Using DynamoDB transactions to notify internal teams is not a typical use case for transactions. Transactions are designed for atomic operations on multiple items but not for triggering notifications.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Current Application Publishing to SNS</span></strong><span>: Having the current application publish messages to multiple SNS topics could potentially affect the performance of the application. Additionally, managing multiple SNS topics adds complexity.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>Cron Job and Custom Attribute</span></strong><span>: Adding a custom attribute and using a cron job to scan the table every minute introduces additional operational overhead and latency. Scanning the table frequently can also impact the performance and cost.</span></p><p><span>By enabling DynamoDB Streams and using Lambda triggers to publish to an SNS topic, the company can efficiently send alerts to internal teams with minimal impact on the current application&#39;s performance and minimal operational overhead.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>
