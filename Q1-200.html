Receive a Snowball Edge device on-premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>AWS Snowball Edge</span></strong><span>: Snowball Edge is a data transfer service that uses secure physical devices to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. It is designed to handle large-scale data migrations and can transfer data much faster than over the internet.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Efficient Data Transfer</span></strong><span>: By using a Snowball Edge device, the company can transfer the 70 TB of video files quickly and securely without consuming significant network bandwidth. The device is shipped to the company&#39;s premises, where the data is transferred locally, and then the device is shipped back to AWS for data import.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other solutions have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>AWS CLI and IAM Role</span></strong><span>: Using the AWS CLI to copy 70 TB of data over the internet would consume a large amount of network bandwidth and take a considerable amount of time.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>S3 File Gateway with Public Service Endpoint</span></strong><span>: This solution would still require transferring 70 TB of data over the internet, consuming significant network bandwidth.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>AWS Direct Connect and S3 File Gateway</span></strong><span>: While Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection, setting it up can be time-consuming and may not be the fastest solution for immediate data migration needs.</span></p><hr /><h3 id='question-7-decouple-and-scale-an-application-that-ingests-and-processes-up-to-100000-messages-per-second'><span>Question #7 Decouple and scale an application that ingests and processes up to 100,000 messages per second</span></h3><p><strong><span>Topic I</span></strong></p><p><span>A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability. Which solution meets these requirements?</span></p><p><span>A. Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.</span></p><p><span>B. Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics.</span></p><p><span>C.

Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon SNS and SQS</span></strong><span>: Amazon SNS is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Decoupling and Scalability</span></strong><span>: By publishing messages to an SNS topic and using multiple SQS subscriptions, the solution can decouple the ingestion of messages from their processing. Each consumer application can read from its own SQS queue, allowing for independent scaling and processing of messages. This setup can handle sudden spikes in message volume and ensures that messages are reliably delivered and processed.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other solutions have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics</span></strong><span>: This service is more suited for real-time analytics rather than decoupling message ingestion and processing.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Auto Scaling EC2 Instances</span></strong><span>: While Auto Scaling can help with scalability, it does not inherently decouple the ingestion and processing of messages, and managing EC2 instances adds operational overhead.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>Kinesis Data Streams with a Single Shard</span></strong><span>: A single shard in Kinesis Data Streams may not be sufficient to handle sudden spikes of 100,000 messages per second.

Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon SQS</span></strong><span>: Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. By using SQS as a destination for the jobs, the solution can handle variable workloads and ensure that jobs are reliably queued for processing.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Auto Scaling Based on Queue Size</span></strong><span>: Configuring EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the SQS queue allows the compute nodes to scale dynamically in response to the workload. As the number of jobs in the queue increases, more EC2 instances are launched to process the jobs, and as the number of jobs decreases, the number of instances is reduced. This ensures that the application can handle variable workloads efficiently and cost-effectively.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other solutions have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Scheduled Scaling</span></strong><span>: Using scheduled scaling does not provide the same level of responsiveness to variable workloads as scaling based on queue size.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>AWS CloudTrail</span></strong><span>: CloudTrail is used for logging and monitoring API calls and is not suitable as a destination for jobs.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>Amazon EventBridge</span></strong><span>: EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) is used for event-driven architectures and is not suitable as a destination for jobs in this context.

Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Decoupling and Scalability</span></strong><span>: By setting up two Lambda functions and using Amazon SQS to integrate them, you can decouple the process of receiving information from the process of loading it into the database. This allows each function to scale independently based on the workload.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Handling High Volumes of Data</span></strong><span>: Amazon SQS can handle large volumes of messages and provides a reliable way to queue the data. The second Lambda function can process the messages from the queue at a rate that the database can handle, preventing overloading.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Minimizing Configuration Effort</span></strong><span>: This solution leverages managed services (Lambda and SQS) that require minimal configuration and management. It avoids the complexity of managing EC2 instances or refactoring the application to use a different database platform.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Refactoring to Apache Tomcat on EC2</span></strong><span>: This approach involves significant refactoring and increases the operational overhead of managing EC2 instances and the application server.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Changing to DynamoDB and DAX</span></strong><span>: This requires a complete change of the database platform, which involves significant refactoring and may not be suitable if the application relies on features specific to Aurora PostgreSQL.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>Using Amazon SNS</span></strong><span>: While SNS can be used for pub/sub messaging, it is not as suitable as SQS for handling high volumes of data that need to be processed in a controlled manner.

Configure an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Application Load Balancer (ALB)</span></strong><span>: An ALB is designed to handle HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced routing capabilities. It supports HTTP health checks, which can be used to monitor the health of the web service running on the EC2 instances.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>HTTP Health Checks</span></strong><span>: By enabling HTTP health checks on the ALB and supplying the URL of the company&#39;s application, the ALB can automatically detect HTTP errors and mark instances as unhealthy. This ensures that traffic is only routed to healthy instances.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Auto Scaling Actions</span></strong><span>: Configuring an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances ensures that any instance marked as unhealthy by the ALB&#39;s health checks is automatically terminated and replaced with a new instance. This improves the application&#39;s availability without requiring manual intervention.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following considerations:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>HTTP Health Checks on NLB</span></strong><span>: Network Load Balancers do not support HTTP health checks. They are designed for TCP/UDP traffic and can only perform basic TCP health checks. Therefore, enabling HTTP health checks on an NLB is not possible.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Cron Job on EC2 Instances</span></strong><span>: Adding a cron job to check logs and restart the application introduces additional complexity and operational overhead.

For RPO recovery, restore the DynamoDB table by using the EBS snapshot.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>B. Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)</span></strong><span>: PITR allows you to back up your DynamoDB table data continuously and restore to any point in time within the last 35 days. This feature is designed to help protect against accidental writes or deletes.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Meeting RPO and RTO Requirements</span></strong><span>: With PITR, you can achieve an RPO of 15 minutes because you can restore the table to any point within the last 35 days, ensuring minimal data loss. The restoration process is straightforward and can be completed within the RTO of 1 hour.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>DynamoDB Global Tables</span></strong><span>: While global tables provide high availability and disaster recovery across regions, they are not designed specifically for meeting RPO and RTO requirements related to data corruption. They also do not provide point-in-time recovery.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>Export to S3 Glacier</span></strong><span>: Exporting data to S3 Glacier on a daily basis does not meet the RPO of 15 minutes, as the data would be up to 24 hours old. Additionally, restoring from Glacier can take several hours, which does not meet the RTO of 1 hour.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>EBS Snapshots</span></strong><span>: DynamoDB does not use EBS volumes, so taking EBS snapshots is not applicable.

A solutions architect needs to share an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an existing AWS account with the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account. The AMI is backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and uses an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt EBS volume snapshots.</span></p><p><strong><span>What is the MOST secure way for the solutions architect to share the AMI with the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account?</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Make the encrypted AMI and snapshots publicly available. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account to use the key.</span></p><p><span>B.

Share the AMI with the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account only. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account to use the key.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Launch Permissions</span></strong><span>: Modifying the </span><code>launchPermission</code><span> property of the AMI to share it with the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account ensures that only the specified account can use the AMI. This approach restricts access to the AMI to the MSP Partner&#39;s account only, enhancing security.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>KMS Key Policy</span></strong><span>: Modifying the key policy to allow the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account to use the KMS key ensures that the MSP Partner can decrypt the EBS volume snapshots that back the AMI. This is necessary because the EBS volumes are encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Security Considerations</span></strong><span>: This approach ensures that the AMI and the associated encrypted snapshots are shared securely. It avoids making the AMI and snapshots publicly available, which would expose them to unauthorized access.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following considerations:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Publicly Available AMI</span></strong><span>: Making the encrypted AMI and snapshots publicly available is not secure and exposes the data to unauthorized access.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>Trusting a New KMS Key</span></strong><span>: Modifying the key policy to trust a new KMS key owned by the MSP Partner adds unnecessary complexity. The MSP Partner can use the existing KMS key if the key policy is modified to allow access.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>Exporting AMI to S3</span></strong><span>: Exporting the AMI to an S3 bucket and then copying it to the MSP Partner&#39;s account introduces additional steps and complexity. It is not the most secure or efficient approach compared to directly sharing the AMI and modifying the key policy.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, the most secure way for the solutions architect to share the AMI with the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account is to modify the launchPermission property of the AMI to share it with the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account only and modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner&#39;s AWS account to use the key.</span></p><hr /><h3 id='question-81-designing-a-loosely-coupled-and-scalable-application-on-aws'><span>Question #81: Designing a Loosely Coupled and Scalable Application on AWS</span></h3><p><strong><span>Question:</span></strong></p><p><span>A solutions architect is designing the cloud architecture for a new application being deployed on AWS.

The company is launching its product in Europe, and it wants to optimize site loading times for new European users. The site&#39;s backend must remain in the United States. The product is being launched in a few days, and an immediate solution is needed.</span></p><p><strong><span>What should the solutions architect recommend?</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in us-east-1 and migrate the site to it.</span></p><p><span>B. Move the website to Amazon S3. Use Cross-Region Replication between Regions.</span></p><p><span>C. Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers.</span></p><p><span>D. Use an Amazon Route 53 geoproximity routing policy pointing to on-premises servers.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>C. Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Amazon CloudFront</span></strong><span>: CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that can cache and deliver content globally with low latency. By using CloudFront, you can ensure that European users get faster access to your website content, as CloudFront caches content at edge locations closer to the users.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Custom Origin</span></strong><span>: By configuring CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to your on-premises servers in the United States, you can keep the backend in the US while optimizing the loading times for European users. CloudFront will fetch and cache content from the on-premises servers, reducing the load times for users accessing the site from Europe.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Immediate Solution</span></strong><span>: This approach can be implemented quickly, which is crucial given the product launch timeline.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following considerations:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Launching an EC2 Instance in us-east-1</span></strong><span>: This does not address the need to optimize site loading times for European users, as the instance would still be located in the US.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Moving the Website to Amazon S3</span></strong><span>: While S3 with Cross-Region Replication could improve access times, it is more suited for static content.

This is achieved by specifying the VPC ID or VPC endpoint in the bucket policy.</span></p></li><li><p><span>This approach adheres to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that access to the sensitive data is restricted to authorized instances only.</span></p></li></ul></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following considerations:</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Making Objects Public</span></strong><span>: Creating a bucket policy to make the objects in the S3 bucket public would expose sensitive information to the internet, which is not secure.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>IAM User with S3 Access Policy</span></strong><span>: Creating an IAM user and copying the IAM credentials to the EC2 instances is not a secure practice. It is better to use IAM roles and policies to manage access securely.</span></p><p><span>E. </span><strong><span>NAT Instance</span></strong><span>: Using a NAT instance to access the S3 bucket is unnecessary and less secure compared to using a VPC gateway endpoint. NAT instances are typically used for providing internet access to instances in private subnets, not for accessing S3.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, the most secure and appropriate steps to provide access to the S3 bucket from the application tier running on EC2 instances inside a VPC are to configure a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 within the VPC and create a bucket policy that limits access to only the application tier running in the VPC.</span></p><hr /><h3 id='question-93-improving-elasticity-and-availability-for-a-mysql-database'><span>Question #93 Improving Elasticity and Availability for a MySQL Database</span></h3><p><strong><span>Question:</span></strong></p><p><span>A company runs an on-premises application that is powered by a MySQL database.

What should a solutions architect do to reduce the operational burden?</span></p><p><strong><span>Answer Options:</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect the encryption keys.</span></p><p><span>B. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to protect the encryption keys.</span></p><p><span>C. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create, store, and assign the encryption keys.</span></p><p><span>D. Use an IAM policy to limit the scope of users who have access permissions to protect the encryption keys.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>B. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to protect the encryption keys.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</span></strong><span>: AWS KMS is a managed service that makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. KMS integrates with many AWS services to simplify the encryption of data at rest and in transit. It provides a highly available, secure, and scalable key management infrastructure, which significantly reduces the operational burden on developers and administrators.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Operational Efficiency</span></strong><span>: KMS handles key creation, storage, and management, including key rotation, which reduces the need for manual intervention and complex key management processes. It also provides detailed logging and auditing through AWS CloudTrail, which helps in maintaining security and compliance.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following considerations:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</span></strong><span>: While MFA is an important security measure to protect access to resources, it does not provide a key management infrastructure. MFA is used to enhance security for user authentication, not to manage encryption keys directly.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</span></strong><span>: ACM is used to manage SSL/TLS certificates for securing network communications. It is not designed for general encryption key management. ACM simplifies the process of provisioning and managing certificates but does not provide the same functionality as KMS for managing encryption keys.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>IAM Policy to Limit Access</span></strong><span>: Using IAM policies to limit access to encryption keys is a good security practice, but it does not provide a comprehensive key management solution. IAM policies help in controlling access but do not address the operational aspects of key creation, storage, rotation, and auditing.</span></p><p><span>By using AWS KMS, the company can build a scalable and secure key management infrastructure that supports developers&#39; encryption needs while minimizing operational overhead.</span></p><hr /><h3 id='question-123-increasing-performance-of-a-web-application-with-ssl-termination'><span>Question #123: Increasing Performance of a Web Application with SSL Termination</span></h3><p><strong><span>Question:</span></strong></p><p><span>A company has a dynamic web application hosted on two Amazon EC2 instances.

The job is stateless in nature, can be started and stopped at any given time with no negative impact, and typically takes upwards of 60 minutes total to complete. The company has asked a solutions architect to design a scalable and cost-effective solution that meets the requirements of the job.</span></p><p><strong><span>What should the solutions architect recommend?</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Implement EC2 Spot Instances.</span></p><p><span>B. Purchase EC2 Reserved Instances.</span></p><p><span>C. Implement EC2 On-Demand Instances.</span></p><p><span>D. Implement the processing on AWS Lambda.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Answer:</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Implement EC2 Spot Instances.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>EC2 Spot Instances</span></strong><span>: Spot Instances allow you to take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at a significantly reduced cost compared to On-Demand Instances. Since the batch processing job is stateless and can be started and stopped at any time without negative impact, it is well-suited for Spot Instances. This makes Spot Instances a cost-effective solution for highly dynamic and interruptible workloads.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Cost-Effectiveness</span></strong><span>: Spot Instances can offer savings of up to 90% compared to On-Demand pricing. This makes them an ideal choice for batch processing jobs that can tolerate interruptions and do not require continuous uptime.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following considerations:</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>Reserved Instances</span></strong><span>: Reserved Instances are best suited for predictable, long-term workloads where you can commit to using the instances for a one- or three-year term. They provide cost savings compared to On-Demand Instances but are not as flexible or cost-effective for highly dynamic and interruptible workloads like the described batch processing job.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>On-Demand Instances</span></strong><span>: On-Demand Instances provide flexibility and do not require long-term commitments, but they are more expensive than Spot Instances. They are suitable for workloads that require continuous uptime and cannot tolerate interruptions, which is not the case for the described batch processing job.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>AWS Lambda</span></strong><span>: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that is ideal for short-lived, event-driven functions. However, it is not well-suited for long-running batch processing jobs that take upwards of 60 minutes to complete.

The web tier consists of a load balancer that sends traffic to Amazon EC2 instances. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS DB instance. The EC2 instances and the RDS DB instance should not be exposed to the public internet. The EC2 instances require internet access to complete payment processing of orders through a third-party web service. The application must be highly available.</span></p><p><strong><span>Which combination of configuration options will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in private subnets. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.</span></p><p><span>B. Configure a VPC with two private subnets and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the private subnets.</span></p><p><span>C.

Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in private subnets. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.</span></p><p><span>D. Configure a VPC with one public subnet, one private subnet, and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Auto Scaling Group in Private Subnets</span></strong><span>: Launching EC2 instances in private subnets ensures that they are not exposed to the public internet. Using an Auto Scaling group helps maintain high availability by distributing instances across multiple Availability Zones. Deploying an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets ensures that the database is also not exposed to the public internet and remains highly available.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>VPC Configuration with Public and Private Subnets</span></strong><span>: Configuring a VPC with one public subnet, one private subnet, and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones allows the EC2 instances in the private subnets to access the internet through the NAT gateways for tasks such as payment processing. Deploying an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet ensures that incoming traffic can be routed to the EC2 instances in the private subnets.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following drawbacks:</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>ALB in Private Subnets</span></strong><span>: Deploying an Application Load Balancer in private subnets would not allow external traffic to reach the web tier, which is not suitable for an ecommerce website.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>EC2 Instances in Public Subnets</span></strong><span>: Launching EC2 instances in public subnets would expose them to the public internet, which does not meet the requirement of keeping the EC2 instances private.</span></p><p><span>E. </span><strong><span>Two Public Subnets and Two Private Subnets</span></strong><span>: While this configuration ensures high availability, it introduces unnecessary complexity and cost by maintaining additional public subnets that are not required for the given scenario.</span></p><hr /><h3 id='question-126-reducing-storage-costs-for-long-term-data-retention'><span>Question #126 Reducing Storage Costs for Long-Term Data Retention</span></h3><p><strong><span>Question:</span></strong></p><p><span>A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to reduce a company&#39;s storage costs.

Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Data Availability and Retrieval</span></strong><span>: The requirement specifies that data from the most recent 2 years must be highly available and immediately retrievable. This means that the data should remain in a storage class that provides high availability and low latency access for the first 2 years.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Cost-Effective Long-Term Storage</span></strong><span>: For data that needs to be retained for at least 25 years but does not require immediate retrieval after the first 2 years, Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective storage class. It is designed for long-term data archiving with retrieval times of hours, making it suitable for data that is infrequently accessed.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>S3 Lifecycle Policy</span></strong><span>: By setting up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years, the company can ensure that data is stored cost-effectively while meeting the requirement for high availability and immediate retrieval for the most recent 2 years.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following considerations:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>Immediate Transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive</span></strong><span>: Transitioning objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive immediately does not meet the requirement for high availability and immediate retrieval of data from the most recent 2 years.</span></p><p><span>C. </span><strong><span>S3 Intelligent-Tiering with Archiving Option</span></strong><span>: While S3 Intelligent-Tiering can automatically move data to the most cost-effective access tier based on changing access patterns, it may not specifically meet the requirement to retain data in a highly available and immediately retrievable state for the first 2 years. Additionally, enabling the archiving option would still need to be managed to ensure compliance with the specific 2-year requirement.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>Transition to S3 One Zone-IA and then to S3 Glacier Deep Archive</span></strong><span>: Transitioning objects to S3 One Zone-IA immediately does not provide the same level of availability and durability as S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA. S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone, which may not meet the high availability requirement for the first 2 years.</span></p><p><span>By setting up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years, the company can achieve a balance between high availability for recent data and cost-effective long-term storage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id='question-127-storage-solutions-for-media-company-on-aws'><span>Question #127: Storage Solutions for Media Company on AWS</span></h3><p><strong><span>Question:</span></strong></p><p><span>A media company is evaluating the possibility of moving its systems to the AWS Cloud.

Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>AWS Control Tower</span></strong><span>: AWS Control Tower provides a pre-configured environment to set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. It includes guardrails that can enforce compliance requirements such as restricting internet access and limiting access to specific regions. Implementing data residency guardrails will help ensure that VPCs do not connect to the internet and that resources are only deployed in the ap-northeast-3 Region.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>AWS Organizations and SCPs</span></strong><span>: AWS Organizations allows you to create and manage multiple AWS accounts within a central organization.

The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two applications. The sender application can send about 1,000 messages each hour. The messages may take up to 2 days to be processed. If the messages fail to process, they must be retained so that they do not impact the processing of any remaining messages.</span></p><p><strong><span>Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?</span></strong></p><p><span>A. Set up an Amazon EC2 instance running a Redis database. Configure both applications to use the instance. Store, process, and delete the messages, respectively.</span></p><p><span>B. Use an Amazon Kinesis data stream to receive the messages from the sender application. Integrate the processing application with the Kinesis Client Library (KCL).</span></p><p><span>C.

Data is processed sequentially, but the order of results does not matter. The application uses a monolithic architecture. The only way that the company can scale the application to meet increased demand is to increase the size of the instances. The company&#39;s developers have decided to rewrite the application to use a microservices architecture on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).</span></p><p><strong><span>What should a solutions architect recommend for communication between the microservices?</span></strong></p><p><span>A.

Configure the EC2 instances to consume messages from the queue.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Auto Scaling Group</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>High Availability</span></strong><span>: Moving the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group ensures that the instances can scale out and in based on demand. This helps in maintaining high availability and resilience.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>Decoupling and Resilience</span></strong><span>: By configuring the order system to send messages to an SQS queue, the order processing becomes decoupled from the EC2 instances. This means that if an EC2 instance fails, the messages remain in the queue and can be processed by another instance.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Message Durability</span></strong><span>: SQS ensures that messages are stored durably until they are successfully processed. This prevents the need for users to reprocess orders in case of a system failure.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Message Consumption</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>EC2 Instances Consuming Messages</span></strong><span>: The EC2 instances can be configured to consume messages from the SQS queue. This ensures that the order processing continues even if individual instances fail or are replaced.</span></p></li></ul></li></ol><p><span>The other options have the following considerations:</span></p><p><span>A. </span><strong><span>EventBridge and ECS Task</span></strong><span>: This solution introduces additional complexity by involving Amazon EventBridge and Amazon ECS. It does not directly address the need for message durability and resilience in the order processing system.</span></p><p><span>B. </span><strong><span>ALB Endpoint</span></strong><span>: While an ALB can distribute traffic across multiple instances, it does not provide the same level of decoupling and message durability as SQS. If an instance fails, in-progress requests may be lost.</span></p><p><span>D. </span><strong><span>SNS and Lambda</span></strong><span>: Using SNS and Lambda introduces additional components and complexity. SNS is typically used for pub/sub messaging, whereas SQS is more suitable for decoupled message processing with guaranteed delivery.</span></p><p><span>By moving the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group and configuring the order system to send messages to an SQS queue, the solutions architect can create a resilient and scalable order processing system. This approach ensures that orders are processed automatically even in the event of a system outage, providing a robust solution for the company&#39;s requirements.</span></p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id='question-196-managing-data-retention-in-amazon-dynamodb'><span>Question #196: Managing Data Retention in Amazon DynamoDB</span></h3><p><strong><span>Question:</span></strong></p><p><span>A company runs an application on a large fleet of Amazon EC2 instances.

Extend the application to add an attribute that has a value of the current timestamp plus 30 days to each new item that is created in the table. Configure DynamoDB to use the attribute as the TTL attribute.</span></p><hr /><p><strong><span>Explanation:</span></strong></p><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>DynamoDB Time-to-Live (TTL) Attribute</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>D. Using TTL Attribute</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Amazon DynamoDB provides a built-in Time-to-Live (TTL) feature that automatically deletes items after a specified timestamp. By adding an attribute with a value of the current timestamp plus 30 days to each new item, you can leverage this feature to automatically remove items older than 30 days.</span></p></li><li><p><span>This approach minimizes development effort and operational overhead since DynamoDB handles the deletion of expired items automatically without additional scripts or infrastructure.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Why This Solution Works</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Using the TTL attribute is a cost-effective and straightforward solution. It requires minimal changes to the application and leverages DynamoDB&#39;s native capabilities to manage data retention efficiently.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The TTL feature ensures that data older than 30 days is automatically purged, keeping the table size manageable and reducing storage costs.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Why Other Options Are Not Suitable</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span>A. Redeploying CloudFormation Stack</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Redeploying the CloudFormation stack every 30 days is not practical and involves significant development and operational effort. It also introduces downtime and complexity.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>B. Monitoring Application with EC2 and DynamoDB Streams</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Running a monitoring application on an EC2 instance and using scripts to delete old items adds unnecessary complexity and cost. It requires managing additional infrastructure and custom scripts.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>C. Lambda Function with DynamoDB Streams</span></strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>While using Lambda with DynamoDB Streams to delete old items is feasible, it involves more development effort compared to using the built-in TTL feature.
